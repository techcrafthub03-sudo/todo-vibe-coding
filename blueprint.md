# Todo App Blueprint

## Overview

A simple and elegant to-do application UI with Google Authentication.

## Implemented Features

### Initial UI and Styling
1.  **Project Setup**:
    *   Create a standard Next.js project.
    *   Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

2.  **UI Design**:
    *   **Layout**: A centered, single-column layout.
    *   **Header**: A prominent "Todo App" title.
    *   **Input**: A clean and simple input field with an "Add" button to add new tasks.
    *   **Task List**: A list of tasks with the following features:
        *   Checkbox to mark tasks as complete.
        *   Task text with a strikethrough when completed.
        *   A "Delete" button for each task.
    *   **Styling**:
        *   **Font**: A modern, readable font (e.g., Inter).
        *   **Color Palette**: A minimalist color scheme with a primary accent color for interactive elements.
        *   **Spacing**: Generous spacing for a clean and uncluttered look.
        *   **Icons**: Use icons for "Add" and "Delete" actions to enhance usability.

3.  **Component Structure**:
    *   `app/page.tsx`: The main page component that will contain the entire UI.
    *   `app/globals.css`: Global styles for the application.

### Firebase Integration

1.  **Initialize Firestore**: Set up Firestore to store the to-do items.
2.  **Firebase Configuration**: Create a file to hold the Firebase configuration and initialize the Firebase app.
3.  **Data Fetching**: Fetch the list of to-dos from Firestore in the main page component.
4.  **Server Actions**:
    *   Create a Server Action to add a new to-do to Firestore.
    *   Create a Server Action to toggle the completion status of a to-do in Firestore.
    *   Create a Server Action to delete a to-do from Firestore.
5.  **UI Integration**: Connect the UI elements (input field, checkboxes, delete buttons) to the Server Actions.
6.  **Firebase Authentication**:
    *   Add the Firebase Authentication SDK to the project.
    *   Create a login component with a "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Implement the logic to handle the Google Sign-In flow.
    *   Display user information (e.g., name, profile picture) when logged in.
    *   Add a "Sign out" button.
7.  **Firestore Security Rules**:
    *   Update Firestore security rules to ensure that users can only read and write their own to-do items.
    *   Each to-do item will be associated with the user's UID.
8.  **Update Data Logic**:
    *   Modify the data fetching logic to only retrieve the to-do items for the currently logged-in user.
    *   Update the Server Actions to associate the to-do items with the authenticated user.
